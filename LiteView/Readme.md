# Current state notes (v1.0)

Uses System Drawing for rendering, which is quite slow, and feel slugish, because it is fast to implement.

# Comming features:
LiteView will use OpenGL to display images. This will provide a smooth UX.


# Others (Non prioritary)
Change from Windows Forms to a more stylish UI.
Configurable settings:
- Checkerboards on transparency (or color)
